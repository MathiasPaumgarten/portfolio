                    <h2>WHO<h2>

                    <p>
                        Mathias is a freelance, award winning creative developer. He wrote this short bio
                        in third-person to appear serious and professional, but make no mistake: Itâ€™s merely
                        a facade to the playful and at times silly coder that was born and raised in
                        <app-link href="${ TIROL_LINK }">Austria</app-link>, and currently resides in
                        <app-link href="${ OAKLAND_LINK }">Oakland</app-link>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He spent years working at world class agencies such as B-Reel, Firstborn and others
                        and has dabbled with the best of Silicon Valley working as creative engineer at Google.

                        Who am I kidding, everyone knows I'm writing this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Where was I? ... Right. Over the last decade I have worked with clients of all sizes, from
                        huge international corporations to small projects executed by a single person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Past work has come in all forms and shapes. Apps, Websites, VR/AR, IoT, you name. If it's
                        programmable I can build with it.
                    </p>
